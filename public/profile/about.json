    "about": "Hi, I’m Harshitha Sontika a full-stack software engineer passionate about building scalable systems, seamless user experiences, and cloud-native solutions that solve real-world problems.\n\nWith over 2 years of hands-on experience across startups and distributed teams, I’ve built everything from interactive dashboards and AI-driven tools to resilient backend infrastructures. I’ve consistently delivered impact reducing deployment time by 25%, cutting latency by 45%, and boosting test coverage to 85% through clean architecture and automated pipelines.\n\n On the frontend, I specialize in React.js, TypeScript, and JavaScript, crafting responsive and intuitive interfaces. On the backend, I bring deep experience with Python (FastAPI, Flask) and also have strong production exposure to Java and Spring Boot, allowing me to build performant REST APIs across both ecosystems.\n\n My toolkit extends to Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration, and I’m well-versed in CI/CD with GitHub Actions, cloud deployments on AWS, and real-time monitoring using tools like CloudWatch and Sentry. I also have strong foundations in relational and NoSQL databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB, enabling me to build reliable, data-driven applications that scale."
